## Rebase

- This is Git Rebase and Interactive Rebase example.
- Rebase is used to rewrite commit history.
- Interactive rebase is used to squash multiple commits to a single commit.
- Merging and Rebasing are kind of similar but very different.
- One needs to follow the golden rule of rebasing: The golden rule of git rebase is to never use it on public branches.
